2021-05-06  This extension works fine in **Waterfox Classic**, and that's what I've been using for my wiki, which uses tags extensively.  I use other browsers for other things.

2018-08-17  Currently making a big push to port this thing to webextensions.
            Need to reverse engineer it.

This is my archive of tagsifter and tagsieve with my fixes and workarounds.
I've started development of a completely new version of the firefox extension.
